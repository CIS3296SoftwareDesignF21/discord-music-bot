## Personas
- 1: Designated Peak XV, age 28, is a traveling DJ based out of Philadelphia. She was born in Columbia, Missouri. She obtained a Bachelor's degree from Franklin & Marshall in Neuroscience. She has a partner who owns a Medical Marijuana Clinic. Together they live in Old City, Philadelphia. When she's not creating music she likes to spend time exercising, exploring trails and philosophy, appreciating the city's architecture, and dancing salsa and bachata. She uses Discord to stay connected with her peers and fans. She likes to be able to share her creations and listen to other's sets wherever she goes. She currently uses SoundCloud to share and explore sets. SoundCloud now requires paid subscription for ad-free listening. She is open to using the Discord Music Bot if she can play, pause, and add music to queue sets -- while chatting with her mates.
- 2: Alan, age 17, is a senior high school in Philadelphia. He uses Discord to stay connected with his friends. He likes to listen to music while working on his homework and can share his music with his friends with they are playing online games together like League of Legends and Counter-Strik. He also uses Spotify to share music with his friend but he is not a fan to pay that subscription fee. He is using the Discord Music Bot since is a lot simpler to use and able to share the music at free cost. Plus, he can invite the bot to the channel and share it with his friends.
